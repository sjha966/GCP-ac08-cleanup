Creating a Playbook

We'll create a playbook that will handle the deletion of the subnets. Here's a basic example of what the playbook might look like:

    Create the Playbook:
        In your GitHub repository, create a new file named delete_subnets.yml.

    Define the Playbook:
        Add the following content to delete_subnets.yml:
Commit and Push:

    Commit the changes and push the playbook to your GitHub repository.
In this playbook, we're using the lookup('env', 'GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS') to access the GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS environment variable, which should contain your service account credentials.
